# Changelog

All notable changes to the `vaultpilot-preflight` skill are documented here.
The skill is versioned separately from `vaultpilot-mcp` so an MCP compromise
cannot silently alter the skill's content.

## 0.1.1 — integrity pin (coordinated with vaultpilot-mcp 0.5.3)

- Added an in-file integrity sentinel
  (`VAULTPILOT_PREFLIGHT_INTEGRITY_v1_7780bfeee9a49f01`) as an HTML comment
  near the top of `SKILL.md`. Invisible when the file is rendered, present
  in the raw text the `Skill` tool returns.
- `vaultpilot-mcp` now pins the expected SHA-256 of this `SKILL.md` file in
  its server source code and instructs the agent to verify both the hash
  and the sentinel on every signing flow. See the README "Integrity pin"
  section for the attack classes this defends against and the
  coordinated-release workflow maintainers must follow when editing this
  file.
- **Requires a vaultpilot-mcp release that carries the matching pin.**
  On older MCP versions the agent won't run the hash check — behavior
  degrades back to 0.1.0.

## 0.1.0 — initial release

- Static agent-side invariants for every `vaultpilot-mcp` send flow
  (EVM, TRON, Solana).
- CHECKS PERFORMED block template the agent emits even when the MCP's
  per-call agent-task block is missing.
- Missing-directive detection: the skill instructs the agent to treat
  an absent server-side agent-task block as a possible compromise
  signal and surface it to the user.
